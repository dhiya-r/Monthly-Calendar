# Calendar Generator

## Description
This program asks the user for a month name and start day, then prints the calendar for that month in a 6 row by 7 column grid. It assumes February has 28 days, ignoring leap years.

## How to Run
1. Run the program in your terminal or command prompt.
2. When prompted, enter the name of the month (e.g., 'January', 'February', ..., 'December').
3. Next, enter the start day of the week (e.g., 'Monday', 'Tuesday', ..., 'Sunday').

The program will then print out the calendar for the specified month, starting on the specified day of the week.
